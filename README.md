### Learning Goals:

In this lab the aim is to understand and use the following concepts in order to  Share stateful logic between components:

1. Higher Order Components
2. Render Props

### Steps to follow:

1. Clone this repository - as it have some boilerplate already for you.
2. Insall all the dependancies used in this project by using the following command -> `npx i` or `npx install`.
3. Run the application by using `npm run dev`. You should be able to see the application running as shown below:

### Task:

If you observe, `LikeImage.jsx` and `LikePost.jsx` -> you will notice that, most of logical part is quite similar in both the files. Only the variable names are different, rest everything is similar. This obviously is not a good practice. 

Your task is to solve this `code duplicacy` issue by using the following two concepts:

1. Higher Order Components
2. Render Props

Create two different projects - 

1. In the first project -> solve the issue by HOC.
2. In the second project -> solve the issue by Render props.

You can use any method  ( `class component` or `functional component` ) - in order to implement the above two concepts.

Happy Coding ❤️!
